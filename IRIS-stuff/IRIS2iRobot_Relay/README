To compile the code run:

# make iris


To program the iris mote:
For gateway (Mote 0), the one that will stay connected to the PC, run:

# make iris install,0 mib520,/dev/ttyUSB0

For iRobot node (Mote 1), the one that will connected to the iRobot, run:

# make iris install,1 mib520,/dev/ttyUSB0

----------------
NOTE:

/dev/ttyUSB0 is the default programming port. Used to program the mote only.
/dev/ttyUSB1 is the default communication port. Used for serial communication
with the mote while it is running.

Of any of these ports are in use while connecting the mote to the computer
the system will use the next available port (e.g. ttyUSB2, ttyUSB3 ...etc)
