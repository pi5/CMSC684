This simple application is use to test the TOS_NODE_ID assignment method.

TOS_NODE_ID is variable that can be accessed from within the code.
Its default value is 1, defined as [uint16_t TOS_NODE_ID = 1] inside "system/tos.h"

Usualy its value is used to identify gateway (Sink, or base-station BS) from
other nodes and mostly 0 (zero) is used as the gateway ID.

You can set this value from within your code, but then you might need to have
different copy of the code for each node ID or you can set it during the compile
and upload time like the following:

to program an IRIS mote with ID 0:
# make iris install,0 mib520....etc

to program an IRIS mote with ID 1:
# make iris install,1 mib520....etc

and so on.

So the function of this code is to blink LED 0 id the ID is 0, LED1 for ID 1
and LED2 for ID 2.
